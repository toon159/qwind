## Demo

ðŸ“Œ [https://qwind.pages.dev/](https://qwind.pages.dev/)

<br>

## Getting started

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just a extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

### Project structure

Inside **Qwind** template, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ adaptors/
|   â””â”€â”€ static/
|       â””â”€â”€ vite.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ robots.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/

â”‚   |       â”œâ”€â”€ post-slug-1.md
â”‚   |       â”œâ”€â”€ post-slug-2.md
â”‚   |       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
|   |   â”œ-- service-worker.ts
â”‚   |   â””-- ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.mjs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entry.dev.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entry.preview.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entry.ssr.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ root.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command            | Action                                         |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`      | Installs dependencies                          |
| `npm run dev`      | Starts local dev server at `127.0.0.1:5173/`   |
| `npm run build`    | Build your production site to `./dist/`        |
| `npm run preview`  | Preview your build locally, before deploying   |
| `npm run fmt`      | Format codes with Prettier                     |
| `npm run lint`     | Run Eslint                                     |
| `npm run qwik ...` | Run CLI commands like `qwik add`, `qwik build` |

<br>

### Configuration

Basic configuration file: `./src/config.mjs`

```javascript
export const SITE = {
  name: "Example",

  origin: "https://example.com",
  basePathname: "/", // Change this if you need to deploy to Github Pages, for example
  trailingSlash: true, // Generate permalinks with or without "/" at the end
};
```

<br>

### Deploy

#### Deploy to production (manual)

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build
```

Now, your website is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at
`dist` folder, which you can deploy the folder to any hosting service you
prefer.

#### Deploy to Netlify

## Cloudflare Pages

Cloudflare's [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) CLI can be used to preview a production build locally. To start a local server, run:

```
npm run serve
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8787/](http://localhost:8787/)

### Deployments

[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) are deployable through their [Git provider integrations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/git-integration/).

If you don't already have an account, then [create a Cloudflare account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/pages). Next go to your dashboard and follow the [Cloudflare Pages deployment guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-anything/).

Within the projects "Settings" for "Build and deployments", the "Build command" should be `npm run build`, and the "Build output directory" should be set to `dist`.

### Function Invocation Routes

Cloudflare Page's [function-invocation-routes config](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/routing/#functions-invocation-routes) can be used to include, or exclude, certain paths to be used by the worker functions. Having a `_routes.json` file gives developers more granular control over when your Function is invoked.
This is useful to determine if a page response should be Server-Side Rendered (SSR) or if the response should use a static-site generated (SSG) `index.html` file.

By default, the Cloudflare pages adaptor _does not_ include a `public/_routes.json` config, but rather it is auto-generated from the build by the Cloudflare adaptor. An example of an auto-generate `dist/_routes.json` would be:

```
{
  "include": [
    "/*"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "/_headers",
    "/_redirects",
    "/build/*",
    "/favicon.ico",
    "/manifest.json",
    "/service-worker.js",
    "/about"
  ],
  "version": 1
}
```

In the above example, it's saying _all_ pages should be SSR'd. However, the root static files such as `/favicon.ico` and any static assets in `/build/*` should be excluded from the Functions, and instead treated as a static file.

In most cases the generated `dist/_routes.json` file is ideal. However, if you need more granular control over each path, you can instead provide you're own `public/_routes.json` file. When the project provides its own `public/_routes.json` file, then the Cloudflare adaptor will not auto-generate the routes config and instead use the committed one within the `public` directory.
